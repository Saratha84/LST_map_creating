🌍 Land Surface Temperature Analysis for Sri Lanka 🌡️

I recently conducted a study on Land Surface Temperature (LST) using MODIS satellite data for the year 2024, focusing on Sri Lanka. The analysis provided valuable insights into temporal trends and spatial variations across the country. 📊🗺️
Why MODIS?

MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is an exceptional tool for environmental monitoring, offering:

    High Temporal Resolution: Daily global coverage, perfect for studying dynamic changes like temperature variations.
    Moderate Spatial Resolution: 1 km for LST, striking a balance between detail and coverage.

Methodology:

1️⃣ Dataset Used: MODIS/061/MOD11A1, the daily LST product.
2️⃣ Data Processing:

    Masked invalid values and converted LST to Celsius.
    Generated a mean LST map for spatial analysis.
    Created a time-series chart to observe seasonal trends.
3️⃣ Focus Area: The entire island of Sri Lanka, with analyses at a 1 km resolution.


This analysis demonstrates the power of satellite data like MODIS in understanding climatic variations and supporting applications in agriculture, urban planning, and disaster management.
